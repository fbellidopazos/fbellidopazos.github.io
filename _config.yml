      ## Basic Numerical Methods in Python - Student Oriented (2023)
      ---
      My end of master’s thesis aims to develop an open-source PyPi project that contains some of the fundamental numerical methods that are taught in universities, these methods are simplified for any student to learn - that is - without excess code that improves the overall efficiency of the algorithm
      Not only does this project contain a scripted version of the aforementioned methods, but it also, contains a Jupyter-Integrated Graphical User interface with which the student can see the effects of the algorithm in real time according to his/her input.

      This project aims to help students get a basic understanding of the Numerical Methods implemented and to make them learn Python instead of MATLAB, which requires a fee to use, and it is not as popular as Python in the current market of Programming related jobs.
      * Tech: Python, Jupyter, Numpy, BQPlot, iPyWidgets

      ## The Sturm-Liouville problem and models based on differential equations in the field of acoustics (2022)
      ---
      Study of the Sturm-Liouville theory and modeling of stringed instruments to answer questions like: Why does a violin and a piano sound different? Is there any relationship between mathematics and music?

      * Tech: Python, Latex, Matplotlib, Plotly, Sympy, NumPy,Jupyter, Differential Equations, Functional Analysis.

      ## S.I.R. Modelling in Python (2021)
      ---
      Research oriented, open source, Covid-19 analysis for understanding the mathematical models of S.I.R. (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) underneath the pandemic we have lived.

      * Tech: Python, Jupyter

    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in mathematics and computer science some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      ## Violin
      ---
      I have been playing the violin for 2.5 years, learning how to play the instrument, how to read music, and external courses on music theory. 
      I have been part of an orchestra during the European Youth Music Week 2022 in Oakham, United Kingdom. Additionally, I am part of the music group originated at  Escuela de Sol Menor
      ### Concerts
